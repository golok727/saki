# Saki

I had a idea for a code editor... but, let’s be honest, I have no clue what it’ll turn into. Could be the next big thing, could be a fancy text box. Oh, and it also comes with a GUI framework called Skie—because every project needs at least one thing you don’t understand halfway through.

`skie/skie` -> GUI framework (eventually)
`skie/skie_draw` -> 2D rendering engine (take a look at the examples)
