Example showing how to use `skie_draw::app` to easily start a window with `winit` and use `skie_draw::Canvas` to draw into it

You need to enable `application` feature to use `skie_draw::app`

```toml
[dependencies]
skie-draw = { git = "https://github.com/golok727/saki.git", features = ["application"] }
```

```

```

It also reexports `winit`;
